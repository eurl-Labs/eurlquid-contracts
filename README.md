# Eurlquid Mock Contracts

These contracts are developed using Remix IDE. These contracts are just for preview purpose only for Eurlquid Dapp.

## Overview

This repository contains mock smart contracts for the Eurlquid decentralized application. The contracts provided here are simplified implementations designed for demonstration and preview purposes only.

## Contracts

### SimpleAMM.sol
A simple Automated Market Maker (AMM) contract without LP tokens. This contract demonstrates basic liquidity pool functionality including:
- Pool creation for token pairs
- Adding and removing liquidity
- Token swapping with fees
- Price quotation

### ERC20.sol
A test USDC token (TUSDC) contract that extends the OpenZeppelin ERC20 implementation with minting capabilities for testing purposes.

These contracts should not be used in production environments. They are simplified implementations created for demonstration and testing of the Eurlquid Dapp interface.

## Development

These contracts have been developed and tested using [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/), an online IDE for developing smart contracts.
